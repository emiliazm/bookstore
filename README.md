## Prerequisites

In the previous project, you worked on the setup of a React application using Create React App (CRA), now you should:

- Initialise React app.
- The building blocks of your app should be set as re-usable components. Create a directory for your components.
- Add React Router and set two Routes and Links for the app's navigation:
  - Books - the default view:
   - Should display the list of books (empty at this point but it should be ready for the data) with the Remove button (no funcionality yet).
     - Create a component called Book for displaying a single book (receive a title and an author as prop) and reuse it in a component that displays a list of books.
   - Should have a form for adding a book (no functionality yet).
     - Create a separate component for this form (with inputs for a title and an author [IMPORTANT in the design you can see an input for a category - please replace it with an author.]).
  - Categories:
    - Should display a button "Check status" only.
